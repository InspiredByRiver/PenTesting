Title: Visible error-based SQL injection
date: 11/20/23


# END GOAL:
1. Get Admin Password
2. Log in as admin



# WHAT WE KNOW:
- column_name:
				username = 'administrator'
				password = ' '
				
				
-table_name:
				users
				
				


# Vulnerability: 
-type: SQLi 
			location: cookie header > column_name = TrackingId  = '' |<- Located in the param value 
			
			example: Cookie: TrackingId=DBxJYXDQUqatiMWL; |<- after the " L " 
				 
				 
# METHOD:
- Get DB to act differently:
							payload:
									DBxJYXDQUqatiMWL->|'|<-;
	
						Notes:
								->> We break the DB with just one apostrophy > 500 error messaged returned > we fix this by adding two apostrophies ->|''|<-    and we get back a 200 OK message 

# ANAYLYSIS:
1. Confirm vulnerability: 
						We can inject SQL queries and make the DB react differently:
																					Result: 
																							->| ' ' |<-
																						### here the 2 apostrophy returns 200
																							1 apostrophy returns 500 ###
